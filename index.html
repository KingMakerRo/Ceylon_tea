        <h4>~~1.Ceylon Tea~~</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <p>It was in the British era that Tea was first cultivated and manufactured in Ceylon. Tea from Ceylon was quickly picked up as the finest on the planet, and tea sends out turned into the pillar of the British economy. Housewives and restaurateurs over the globe developed acquainted with the name of the nation, discovering that its appearance on a tin or parcel dependably ensured the nature of the tea inside. Freedom brought new business sectors, and creation kept on expanding. In 1965 Ceylon became, unexpectedly, the world's biggest exporter of tea.

          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
            
The inseparable duo is the lion logo and Ceylon Tea. Any one thinking of Ceylon they think of the logo too thats our trade mark.
For anyone thinking of Ceylon Tea or Ceylon itself the one image that strikes is the lion logo. 
This famous logo can be found in the originally packaged Ceylon Tea Products.
 The inspiration for the logo is Ceylon, its flag and it history itself,
  but this was not all Ceylon Tea’s first, it was first embraced by the Tea propaganda board. And Now The lion is a registered emblem around the world in 100 countries.And now Ceylon Tea and the The lion logo have become the inseparable duo.
  People around the world recognise lion both as Ceylon Tea and Sri Lanka. People now trust us for our quality and know us for our logo.
